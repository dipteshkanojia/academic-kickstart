# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In this talk, I discuss Natural Language Processing, Data Science and how they are related to each other. While presenting the different facets of the NLP research done at our lab, I connected it to how a data scientist can use the research to solve a relatable real-world issue. I discussed the NLP research areas of Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Sarcasm Detection, Speech Processing, Cognitive NLP and then went into details of Computational Phylogenetics and Cognate Detection, the latter two being a part of my Ph.D. Thesis. I also presented some excerpts of his work from a recent publication at CODS-COMAD 2019 and explained how Cognate detection is an important problem in the area of Historical and Cultural Linguistics. The talk was well received as the feedback from the students and some entrepreneurs were positive. Later, it transcended more into an interactive session on what tools can an amateur use to start NLP and what online courses can one pursue to deal with these NLP problems."
