# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Invited lecture at IET Surrey discussing Generative AI and Natural Language Processing. ChatGPT and other large language models are now publicly available offering new opportunities to apply them to problem-solving, with both pros and cons. Taking a people-centered approach to evaluation, Dr Diptesh Kanojia joined us to explain the challenges in utilizing these models and discuss some solutions to tune/adapt such models in resource-constrained scenarios. His talk is illustrated by applications healthcare clinical report generation, text-attribution in education to detect the source of generated text, followed by an insightful Q&A session with the live audience."
