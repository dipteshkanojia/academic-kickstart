# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In three different talks, I discussed various facets of fundamental NLP research being done at CFILT, IIT Bombay. The first talk one was about 'Lexical Resources' and their need in NLP tasks. During the second talk, I discussed the basics of POS tagging, Viterbi and fundamentals of NLP layers. The third talk was more of a demo session where I conducted an interactive hands-on session using Python and NLTK to demonstrate the basics."
