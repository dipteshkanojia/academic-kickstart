abstract = "The workshop explored questions on the lines of how should knowledge about neural machine translation be disseminated in the translator/interpreter community, what is the preferred approach, and how detailed should it be. The presented is just one of the approaches to take when NMT is briefly introduced. Presented at the workshop, '[Teaching Neural Machine Translation to Translators](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-translation-studies/convergence-2023/workshop-teaching-neural-machine-translation-translators)' at [Convergence 2023](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-translation-studies/convergence-2023)."
