Apparently, our garden isn't ours anymore; pretty much annexed by this tabby autocrat. He's a neighbour's cat who visits daily as I envy his discipline. Perches on the fence or the shed roof. Of course! he has vantage points for passing judgement.

Here's the crazy part, given we had pet cats earlier, we *feed him* cat treats. He comes right inside nowadays through the kitchen window and pretty much demands for food.

You'd think this would buy some loyalty, or at least a nice purr, right? Nope. Just an excercise in territorial rights and treat tax collection. 

I will update this page further with more **disdained** looks.
