abstract: "Despite excellent results on benchmarks over a small subset of languages, large language models struggle to process text from languages situated in 'lower-resource' scenarios such as dialects/sociolects (national or social varieties of a language), Creoles (languages arising from linguistic contact between multiple languages) and other low-resource languages. This introductory tutorial will identify common challenges, approaches, and themes in natural language processing (NLP) research for confronting and overcoming the obstacles inherent to data-poor contexts. By connecting past ideas to the present field, this tutorial aims to ignite collaboration and cross-pollination between researchers working in these scenarios. Our notion of 'lower-resource' broadly denotes the outstanding lack of data required for model training - and may be applied to scenarios apart from the three covered in the tutorial."
