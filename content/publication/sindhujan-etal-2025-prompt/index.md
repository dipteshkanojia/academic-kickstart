abstract: "The aim of this project was to curate data for the English-Malayalam language pair for the tasks of Quality Estimation (QE) and Automatic Post-Editing (APE) of Machine Translation. Whilst the primary aim of the project was to create a dataset for a low-resource language pair, we plan to use this dataset to investigate different zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies including chain-of-thought, towards a unified explainable QE-APE framework."
