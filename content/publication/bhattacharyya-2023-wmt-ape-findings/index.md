abstract: "We present the results from the 9th round of the WMT shared task on MT Automatic Post-Editing, which consists of automatically correcting the output of a “black-box” machine translation system by learning from human corrections. Like last year, the task focused on English→Marathi, with data coming from multiple domains (healthcare, tourism, and general/news). Despite the consistent task framework, this year’s data proved to be extremely challenging. As a matter of fact, none of the official submissions from the participating teams succeeded in improving the quality of the already high-level initial translations (with baseline TER and BLEU scores of 26.6 and 70.66, respectively). Only one run, accepted as a “late” submission, achieved automatic evaluation scores that exceeded the baseline."
