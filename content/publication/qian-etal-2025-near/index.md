abstract: "E-commerce information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to simultaneously achieve high accuracy in interpreting complex user queries and maintain efficient processing of vast product catalogs. The dual challenge lies in precisely matching user intent with relevant products while managing the computational demands of real-time search across massive inventories. In this paper, we propose a Nested Embedding Approach to product Retrieval and Ranking, called NEAR², which can achieve up to 12 times efficiency in embedding size at inference time while introducing no extra cost in training and improving performance in accuracy for various encoder-based Transformer models. We validate our approach using different loss functions for the retrieval and ranking task, including multiple negative ranking loss and online contrastive loss, on four different test sets with various IR challenges such as short and implicit queries. Our approach achieves an improved performance over a smaller embedding dimension, compared to any existing models."
