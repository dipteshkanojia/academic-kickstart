I am a {{< staticref "https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/dr-diptesh-kanojia" "newtab" >}}Lecturer at Surrey Institute for People-Centred AI{{< /staticref >}}. My research addresses problems that intersect the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine or Deep Learning (ML/DL). The focus of my research is Machine Translation; working with {{< staticref "https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/sabine-braun" "newtab" >}}Prof. Sabine Braun{{< /staticref >}}, {{< staticref "https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/constantin-orasan" "newtab" >}}Prof. ‪Constantin Orăsan{{< /staticref >}}, {{< staticref "https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/felix-do-carmo" "newtab" >}}Dr. Félix do Carmo{{< /staticref >}} and other colleagues.

Other than that, my interests also lie in the NLP sub-areas of Cognitive NLP, Distributional and Lexical Semantics, Multimodality/Multilingualism in NLP, Sentiment/Emotion Analysis; and Teaching NLP. I graduated with a Joint PhD from the {{< staticref "https://www.iitbmonash.org" "newtab" >}}IITB-Monash Research Academy{{< /staticref >}} ( {{< staticref "https://www.iitb.ac.in" "newtab" >}}IIT Bombay, India{{< /staticref >}} & {{< staticref "https://www.monash.edu" "newtab" >}}Monash University, Australia{{< /staticref >}} ) in 2021; and was advised by {{< staticref "https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb" "newtab" >}}Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya{{< /staticref >}}, {{< staticref "https://users.monash.edu.au/~gholamrh/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Gholamreza Haffari{{< /staticref >}}, and {{< staticref "https://www.hss.iitb.ac.in/en/faculty-profile/malhar-kulkarni" "newtab" >}}Prof. Malhar Kulkarni{{< /staticref >}}. Before starting my PhD, I was a Research Engineer at the {{< staticref "https://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in" "newtab" >}}CFILT Lab{{< /staticref >}}, IIT Bombay, India, where my investigations led to {{< staticref "http://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=UNCgCAEAAAAJ" "newtab" >}}publications{{< /staticref >}} in diverse sub-areas of NLP and AI.
