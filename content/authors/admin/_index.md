I am a Research Fellow working on problems intersecting the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) (broadly in Artificial Intelligence). 

My interests lie in the sub-areas of Machine Translation, Cognitive Psycholinguistics, Distributional and Lexical Semantics, Multimodality/Multilingualism in NLP, Sentiment/Emotion Analysis; and Teaching. Graduating from the IITB-Monash Research Academy (Joint PhD with IIT Bombay, India and Monash University, Australia) in 2021.

Before starting my PhD, I was a Research Engineer at the CFILT Lab, IIT Bombay, India, where my co-investigations led to publications in diverse sub-areas of NLP and AI.
