Researcher working on problems intersecting the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). As a {{< staticref "https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/dr-diptesh-kanojia" "newtab" >}}Lecturer{{< /staticref >}} at Surrey {{< staticref "https://www.surrey.ac.uk/artificial-intelligence" "newtab" >}}Institute for People-Centred AI{{< /staticref >}}  and {{< staticref "https://www.surrey.ac.uk/school-computer-science-and-electronic-engineering" "newtab" >}}School of CS and EE{{< /staticref >}}, I lead teaching on the NLP module for undergraduate and postgraduate students. As a research lead, I manage Human-Machine Interaction theme within PAI, and NLP research at the {{< staticref "https://www.surrey.ac.uk/nature-inspired-computing-and-engineering-research-group" "newtab" >}}Nature Inspired Computing and Engineering group (NICE){{< /staticref >}} group within the {{< staticref "https://www.surrey.ac.uk/computer-science-research-centre" "newtab" >}}Computer Science Research Centre{{< /staticref >}}. 

My research focuses on scalable approaches using foundation models for safe human-machine, and human-human interaction, within social and personal digital spaces. With a People-Centred focus, my existing work contributes to low-resource languages and addressing societal challenges like digital accessibility, online toxicity, and misinformation. Other than these, my interests lie in modelling information from cognitive behaviour (Cognitive NLP), language and multimodal information modelling for machine understanding. Our research outcomes like data, code, and computational models are regularly shared publicly at {{< staticref "https://github.com/surrey-nlp/" "newtab" >}}SurreyNLP Github{{< /staticref >}}, and {{< staticref "https://huggingface.co/surrey-nlp" "newtab" >}}HuggingFace{{< /staticref >}} spaces. 

I was a research fellow at the {{< staticref "https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-translation-studies" "newtab" >}}Centre for Translation Studies{{< /staticref >}}, and continue to collaborate on relevant areas. I completed a Joint PhD from the {{< staticref "https://www.iitbmonash.org/" "newtab" >}}IITB-Monash Research Academy{{< /staticref >}} [{{< staticref "https://www.iitb.ac.in/" "newtab" >}}IIT Bombay, India{{< /staticref >}} & {{< staticref "https://www.monash.edu/" "newtab" >}}Monash University, Australia{{< /staticref >}}], and currently work with industry and academic partners, on areas from above. Before starting my PhD, I was a Research Engineer at the {{< staticref "https://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/" "newtab" >}}CFILT Lab{{< /staticref >}} where my investigations led to {{< staticref "http://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=UNCgCAEAAAAJ" "newtab" >}}publications{{< /staticref >}} in diverse sub-areas of NLP and AI.
